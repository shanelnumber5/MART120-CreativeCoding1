    <title>Story Time!</title>
<body>
    <p><p><center>My artwork is quite varied but I like to believe I specialize in color theory and the idea that involves the analytical study of color theory and feelings that are evoked through color.<p>
       <p>My printmaking and paintings are usually very vibrant and over saturated because I like to bring life into things that are no longer useful to people through color, to make them useful once again.<p></center></p>
    <p><p><center>Each year, my work grows and evolves into something bigger, more interesting, and better.<p> 
        <p>As an artist, there is no greater pleasure for me than finding genuine growth and improvement in my projects.<p> 
        <p>As I have grown and matured, so has my art. Below are some of the pieces I recently created in my studio.<p></center></p>
