    <h1><span><center><u>Why Do I Create Art?</span></u></center></h1>
        <p><p><center><span>My artwork is quite varied but I like to believe I specialize in color theory and the idea that involves the analytical study of color theory and feelings that are evoked through color.<p>
           <p>My printmaking and paintings are usually very vibrant and over saturated because I like to bring life into things that are no longer useful to people through color, to make them useful once again.<p></span></center></p>
        <p><p><center><span>Each year, my work grows and evolves into something bigger, more interesting, and better.<p> 
            <p>As an artist, there is no greater pleasure for me than finding genuine growth and improvement in my projects.<p> 
            <p>As I have grown and matured, so has my art. Below are some of the pieces I recently created in my studio.<p></span
